# Headphones Landing Page

A fully responsive and accessible landing page built from scratch using only **HTML** and **CSS** — no frameworks, no JavaScript.  
This project is part of the **ALX Front-End** curriculum (Week 7), focusing on applying responsive design, accessibility, and semantic HTML concepts to recreate a pixel-perfect webpage based on a designer’s mockup.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The goal was to reproduce the provided design across three breakpoints:

- **Desktop view:** Default layout for screens 1000px and wider.  
- **Tablet view:** Optimized layout for medium screens (between 481px and 999px).  
- **Mobile view:** Simplified single-column layout for screens **480px or less**.

Each version follows the same structure, typography, and colors as shown in the design file.

## 🎨 Design and Interactions

- **Hover/Active States**
  - Links: color changes to `#FF6565`
  - Buttons: opacity changes to `0.9`

- **Layout**
  - The main content has a **maximum width of 1000px**, centered on the page.
  - The layout adapts smoothly using **flexbox** and **media queries**.

- **Accessibility**
  - Semantic HTML tags (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `footer`) used throughout.
  - All images include descriptive `alt` text.
  - Buttons and links are keyboard-navigable.
